## 📘 About the Project

Developers often struggle to identify the right career track and the skills required to advance. **PathCoder** is a machine learning–powered application that predicts the most suitable career track for developers based on their current skills and recommends additional skills to master.

The system leverages:

* **Random Forest** for job prediction
* **Recommendation Engine** for skill suggestions
* **Flask API** for backend inference & integration
* **Streamlit** for an interactive frontend
* **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management

## 🚀 Features

* ✍️ Input your current technical skills
* 🎯 Predict the most suitable career track (e.g., Web Developer, Data Scientist, AI Engineer)
* 💡 Receive personalized skill recommendations
* 🤖 Chatbot assistance for developer career questions
* 📊 Explore explainable predictions (feature importance, SHAP)
* 💾 Track and version ML models with MLflow
* 🔐 Secure authentication (JWT / Firebase if added)
* 🌐 Lightweight, interactive, and user-friendly UI with Streamlit
